  name: 'Door-Activated Lights'
  description: >-
    Turn lights on/off based on door closure and ambient light.

    The targeted lights will turn on when the door is opened, unless the
    ambient light level exceeds a configured threshold. The targeted lights
    will turn off when the door is closed for a duration of `off_delay`.
